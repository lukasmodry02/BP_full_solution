# Chess Game Image Recognition

This project provides a modular and functional system that automatically converts a sequence of chessboard images into standard algebraic notation. It combines computer vision, machine learning, and rule-based logic to interpret moves from a series of static images. The system is divided into two main services:

- **API for Chess Figure Classification** using an ML.NET model.

- **Web app Generator for Chess Notation,** which processes sequences of board states, detects changes,
and reconstructs moves with user friendly *UI*.

# Dockerized Deployment

This project consists of two main services that work together:
- **ChessFiguresClassification_Api** â€“ .NET 8.0 API for chess figure recognition (port `5000`)
- **ChessNotationsGenerator** â€“ .NET 8.0 WebApp for move generation using board images (port `8080`)

These are packaged and deployed using Docker and Docker Compose, with prebuilt images hosted on Docker Hub.

## Quick Start 

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system with linux containers

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukasmodry02/BP_full_solution.git
```
Then navigate to the directory you cloned repo.
```bash
cd <path_to_cloned_repo>
```

### 2. Start the Services
This pulls the published images from Docker Hub and starts the containers:

```bash
docker compose up
```
or 
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
if you want to starts all the services in the background (detached from your terminal).

### 3. Access the App
- **Generator WebApp**: http://localhost:8080

You can send image requests to the Generator, which will call the API to classify chess pieces and return FEN strings.

## ðŸ”§ Compose Configuration

### Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`)
By default, the project uses these **Docker Hub** images:

```yaml
services:
  csharp-chessfiguresclassification_api:
    image: lukasmodry02/bp_chessgame_image_recognition:api
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    networks:
      - chessnet

  csharp-chessnotationsgenerator:
    image: lukasmodry02/bp_chessgame_image_recognition:generator
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - csharp-chessfiguresclassification_api
    networks:
      - chessnet

networks:
  chessnet:
    driver: bridge
```

---

## Testing Locally
You can send base64-encoded image data to the `/api/process` endpoint on port `8080`.

Example using `curl`:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/process      -H "Content-Type: application/json"      -d "{"base64Image": "<your_base64_string_here>"}"
```

## Docker Hub Images
- [Images](https://hub.docker.com/r/lukasmodry02/bp_chessgame_image_recognition/tags)
These are built and pushed from the latest code.
